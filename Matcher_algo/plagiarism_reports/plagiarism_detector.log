History of Thane District Thane District, MaharashtraHistory of Thane District can be divided into four major periods, the early Hindu period partly mythic and partly historic, coming down to about 1300 AD and properly called Ancient period; the Muslim period lasting from 1300 to 1660 AD, the Maratha period from 1660 to 1800 AD; and the British period since 1880. From pre-historic times the Thane coast has had relation with land beyond the Indian Ocean. Thane District forms part of North Konkan also called Aprant (The western end) later known as Puri-Konkan after its capital Puri. The earliest known fact in the history of Thane coast and incidentally of Apranta belongs to engraving of Ashoka edicts. The Shilharas ruled over North Konkan for move than 400 years. During the Mughal period, Turk rulers had destroyed many temples and Churches of the region. Under the strong rule of Muhammad Bin Tughlaq the Mughal`s maintained their supremacy in north Konkan. Portuguese history would be incomplete without the mention of Vasai. The Portuguese power passed into the hands of Maratha after a long siege by Chimaji Appa, brother of Peshwa Bajirao I. For about sixty-four years, from 1739 to 1802 Vasai remained under the Maratha finally, in 1802 by the Treaty of Vasai it became a British possession and in 1818 it was incorporated in the Bombay Presidency.
