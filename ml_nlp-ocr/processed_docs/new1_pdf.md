Why is a custom domain email address good for your business?

Besides helping you showcase your own identity in your communications, custom domain email addresses have many other benefits.

Brand visibility

When a prospect looks at your email address, they will quickly be able to find your business by looking up your domain name.

Credibility

An email address that contains your business name sounds more official and trustworthy than an email address that doesn't have a custom domain.

Consistency

As your workforce grows, you can standardize email addresses and create consistent group addresses for roles, like support@yourdomain.com.

Brand marketing

While there are numerous ways to market your business name, a custom email address is the simplest.
